This page was authored in Markdown, a user-friendly format that easily integrates with web pages, which are typically written in HTML.  

This template site is rendered through Hugo, an open-source site generator that can take Markdown files and turn them into fully-functional web documents, such as this one. The biggest benefit of such a system is its reliability, followed closely by speed, and customization.

Branding elements can be fully controlled by the developer / branding expert, while the text content of the pages can be generated by IJM's authors, and later on edited / finalized by the appropriate editorial teams. 

### Styling elements, such as this header, can be generated automatically in Markdown. No added coding required.

The Hugo platform that generates this site can export a build folder for integration with IJM's osec.ijm.org server. This makes the content fully functional at any location that the site administrator / BMC specifies, making it easy to integrate the output as a part of our official web presence (instead of using a discrete domain).

The final benefit we wish to highlight is the durability of its code base. ALl the code used for this page is backed up with each build, and stored on github, a world class version control platform.

In the event of a site malfunction / server disaster, the source code can be used to easily rebuild the content you see here into a separate web application. It can also be re-integrated with the recovered site with little overhead.

### Options available to release content as separate programs / applications

Meanwhile, if IJM decides that specific products are better released as separate applications, either for security purposes (gated content) or because we wish to collaborate with a partner and not use the IJM brand, this is possible with simple tweaks to the theme.
